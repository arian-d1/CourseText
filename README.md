# CourseText

CourseText is a web platform designed to help UBC students buy, sell, and find course-related materials such as textbooks, notes, and resources. It offers a clean and responsive user interface, user authentication, and listings management.

This project is built to solve a common problem for university studentsâ€”finding affordable course materials from trusted peers in a centralized, easy-to-use space.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login with session management.
- **Course-Based Listings**: Users can post and browse listings tied to specific UBC course codes (e.g. CPSC 221).
- **Search and Filtering**: Listings can be filtered by title or course code.
- **Listing Management**: Authenticated users can create and delete their own listings.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully usable across desktop and mobile.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** 
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **Vite** as the build tool

### Backend
- **Node.js** with **Express**
- **PostgreSQL** for relational data storage
- **passport.js** and cookie-based auth for session management
- **Express-Validator** for server-side input validation
- **dotenv** for environment config

### Deployment
- **Vercel** for the frontend
- **Render** for the backend
- **Neon** for the postgreSQL database

## Why I Built This

As a UBC student, I noticed that course materials were often scattered across various platforms or shared informally through chat groups. CourseText provides a single, organized place for students to exchange resources safely and efficiently. It also gave me the opportunity to apply full-stack development skills in a real-world context with a focus on clean design and solid backend architecture.

## Future Plans

- Ratings or reviews for sellers
- Mobile version via React Native
